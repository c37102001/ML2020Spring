# Logistic regression
* in _gradient(X, Y_label, w, b)
  * Why loss(pred_error) is not counted by _cross_entropy_loss?
  * Shouldn't we count CELoss first then count its gradient?
  * Similarly, why in hw1 loss and gradient count in different way?

* Please explant what does 'Logistic Regression' mean.

# Generative model
* Covarience matrix: http://greenhornfinancefootnote.blogspot.com/2007/08/covariance-and-correlation-coefficient.html
* Why Y_train_pred = 1 - predict(X_train, w, b) instead of predict(X_train, w, b) like logistic regression does?
